Welcome to Keyboard Warrior
There are 5 floors in this game, each with a different enemy
To progress up the floors, you have to encounter each enemy and challenge them to a typing game of speed
Each enemies has its own weaknesses, turn those weaknesses into your attacks against them
When the game starts, you will be given a time limit to type as many attack words as you can
Each word has to be accurate, including space and capitals
The enemies will also launch an attack on you, dealing you damage or healing themselves up
Last one standing wins the game
Let's test this out shall we?

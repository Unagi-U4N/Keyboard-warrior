( playername is an ordinary student in MMU, he is, like most others, tired of university life, assignments everywhere )
( Everyday is a tiring day, you just hope that one day all of these will finally come to an end )

( Finally when your brain starts to shut down and your consciousness fades... )

playername : Whaaaa...? What's that?
( You were woken up in a classroom full of students, as if you somehow teleported here )
playername : A quiz? Seriously?
Teacher: Quickly, type your name in the quiz header!

Student: (whispering) Can't you see? This isn't reality. It's a dream.

Type: How do I escape?
!Input How do I escape?
